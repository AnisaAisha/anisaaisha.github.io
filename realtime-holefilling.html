        <h1>Enhancing 3D Mesh Toplogy for Real-time Reconstruction</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                As part of my Master's coursework at Georgia Tech, I worked on a research-based project for an year with Dr. Greg Turk.

                <p>
                    As AR technology continues to proliferate across various fields,
                    from gaming to industrial design, the demand for accurate and immersive AR experiences
                    has grown substantially. However, one challenge hindering the effectiveness of AR
                    applications is the inaccuracy in object placement within physical spaces, primarily due to
                    limitations in the scanning capabilities of mobile devices or AR hardware.
                    These inaccuracies often lead to incomplete or incorrect 3D representations, manifesting
                    as "blind spots" or gaps in the scanned environment. These gaps not only limit the user's
                    interaction within the AR space but also restrict the exploration area to predefined
                    boundaries, preventing AR applications from fully realizing their potential.
                    This research project aims to address these "blind spots" by exploring the
                    application of hole filling and mesh repair techniques during real-time scanning (focusing
                    on AR environments). The goal is to fill the gaps that arise during the scanning process,
                    thereby improving the accuracy and continuity of the 3D environment in real-time. The
                    research will also focus on addressing challenging scenarios, such as filling voids between
                    different types of meshes (e.g., the gap between a wall and a piece of furniture) and gaps between two distinct
                    objects.

                            Our real-time mesh reconstruction pipeline first obtains scanned data from the real world, and then integrates several algorithms to reconstruct the meshes in real-time.

                            <li><strong>Platform Used: </strong>On mobile devices, raw LiDAR data is not directly available to access. Our project utilizes Unity's ARFoundation toolkit to extract the scanned data in the form of point clouds and depth maps.</li>
                            <li><strong>Depth Maps: </strong>Depth maps obtained from the scanning process provide an approximation of how close or far objects are in a scene. They can visualize the distance of an object from the camera or a specific viewpoint, including any obstructions or overlapping objects that may lead to the creation of holes in the obtained scene.</li>

                <p>
                    A spatial data structure is used to store the connectivity information in a 3D mesh. Our pipeline utilizes the half-edge data structure,
                    as it enables us to instantly query the points in a mesh (vertices) and triangles (faces). Particularly, we utilize the property of missing opposites/twins
                    for boundary edges, and then check for a closed loop.

                <p>We test our pipeline by using multiple algorithms and analyzing which one of them is more effective. </p>
                <h5>Filling Algorithms</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Centroid-based Filling: </strong>A simple approach that creates a new point at the center of the hole,
                        and every vertex on the boundary is connected to it. If the holes are not flat and exist on a curvature, inaccurate results are produced using this approach.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Loop Split: </strong>A modification of a triangulation algorithm to connect non-neighboring vertices repeatedly, based on average split plane of the hole, such that it fills the hole.</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Enhancement Algorithms</h5>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Edge Flips: </strong>Flip edges between triangles/mesh based on triangle aspect ratios.</li>
                        <li><strong>Edge Splits: </strong>Divide long edges at midpoint.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smoothing: </strong>Apply Laplacian smoothing by adjusting position of vertices based on nearby vertices.</li>
                    </ul>
