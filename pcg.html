                As part of my Master's coursework at Georgia Tech, I took a course on Procedural Content Generation during Fall 2024 with Dr. Greg Turk.
                The projects for this course focused on utilizing procedural techniques to generate 3D assets. All projects were created in Unity.
                These projects use various techniques such as,
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Perlin Noise</li>
                <li>Plant Generation Algorithms</li>
                <li>Implicit Surfaces</li>
                <li>Marching Cubes Algorithm</li>
                <li>Random Number Generation</li>
                <li>Craig Reynold's Flocking Principles</li>
            </ul>

            A classic ray tracer is can only produce simple shadows and materials with diffuse shading. This project also implements
            the distributed ray tracing algorithm, which shoots multiple rays per pixel to implement several effects that cannot be achieved using
            a simple ray tracer such as anti-aliasing, soft shadows, motion blur, glossy reflections and depth of field.
        </p>

            Below are some sample images from the ray tracing project.

                Created a height map terrain extending in XZ direction, with variations in height (Y direction). The elevation variations were created using
                three bands of Perlin noise, with different spatial frequency and amplitude, giving fractal like qualities to the generated terrain. Color variations
                were added to the terrain using texture maps. For this particular terrain, I chose a desert-landscape theme and generated textures accordingly.
                The project also features the ability to create additional terrain on demand, that is, once the camera moves to the edge of the terrain, it generates a new
                terrain that is a natural extension of current terrain.  In doing so, surface normals at the seams were
                calculated to match each other to avoid inconsistencies. A first person camera view was also added. Simple plants, such as cacti and falling rocks were also placed in the scene. The scene was also made such that 
                there are valleys where the rocks pile into.

                This project is a procedural flocking animator. Based on Craig Reynold's rules of interaction, four forces were defined to govern the creature behavior
                in flocks (flock centering, velocity matching, collision avoidance, wandering). A balanced out values of these forces provide realistic like flock simulation.
                The creatures can also leave behind trails, and there are obstacles in the scene which make the behavior more realistic/immersive.
