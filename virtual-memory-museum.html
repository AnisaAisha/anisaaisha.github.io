        <h1>Virtual Memory Museum</h1>
        <div>
            <p>
                As part of <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/liaolab/people/">JANUS Lab</a> at Georgia Tech, I helped design a Virtual Museum
                in Unity with SteamVR on HTC Vive Pro headset. This project aims to test episodic memory, the effects of virtual reality
                on the psyche of people, and the ability of older adults to recall events from their life. This project is currently in development.
            </p>
            <p>
                As part of the project, I worked closely with lab members on testing the VR environment, researched previous relevant studies 
                to create the study questionnaire (usability testing document) for the project.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed and modeled the architecture and layout of the virtual museum. </li>
                        <li>
                            Researched user behavior and comfort in VR environments to optimize the layout of the space and adjust the
                            dimensions of the museum structure, sculptures, photos, and other relevant objects. This research was tailored
                            for both young and older adults to ensure usability and accessibility, such as offering a seated experience in
                            some areas and a standing experience in others.
                        </li>
                        <li>Optimized lighting to create a visually appealing and comfortable VR space, ensuring assets were well-lit without overwhelming users. This included spotlights and directional lighting to similar to an in-person museum.</li>
                        <li>Incorporated dynamic lighting during drag-and-drop interactions, where photo frames light up to indicate the target frame for the photo.</li>
                        <li>Arranged 3D objects in the VR space such that aesthetics and realism were balanced, creating an immersive experience.</li>
                    </ul>
